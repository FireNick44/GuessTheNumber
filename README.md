## Introduction

In my first semester at the [IMS](https://beruf.lu.ch/Berufslehre/Berufslehre_im_Betrieb/Berufsfachschule/berufsbildungszentren/fmz/fmz_ausbildung/Informatikmittelschule), I wrote this program. At that time I had no background knowledge in programming and was still quite a beginner. Two semesters later, I decided to fix my old mistakes and rewrite the code with my new skills.

The program generates a simple random number that the user must figure out. A very simple game if you can call it a game at all. However, I think you can see basic knowledge and good improvements in the code.


## Installation & Issues

Clone or download the project, open the project in visual studio 2022. Alternatively, you can run the two .cpp files through an external software. _(visual studio code, eclipse, clion...)_

>_I started the project in visual studio 2019 and updated it to visual studio 2022. Visual Studio 2022 uses the buildertools v143 which are not compatible with visual studio 2019._
